    "For quick demonstrations, experiments and debugging it is very handy to use a Jupyter Notebook (this type of document, which you are looking at right now).  \n",

    "In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example includes both the input and the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, so the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.  \n",
    "*Example: Supervised learning is like a teacher providing the correct answers to math problems, and the student (model) learns to solve similar problems in the future.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Unsupervised Learning**:  \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the model is given data without labeled outcomes and must find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own. Itâ€™s commonly used for clustering or dimensionality reduction.  \n",
    "*Example: Unsupervised learning is like exploring a new city without a map, trying to discover the layout and important landmarks by observing patterns in the environment.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Reinforcement Learning**:  \n",
    "Reinforcement learning involves an agent that learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes (trial and error), and aiming to maximize the cumulative reward over time.  \n",
    "*Example: Reinforcement learning is like training a dog, where the dog learns good behavior by receiving treats for actions that are rewarded and avoiding actions that result in scolding.*\n"

It does not need to be all-encompassing or generally agreeable. Instead, it should highlight the aspects most important to you. Then discuss your definition with your neighbors and see whether you would stick to your original proposal or whether you tend to modify it based on the discussion."
