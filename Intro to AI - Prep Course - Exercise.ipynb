    "- In a Python cell below provide the code to print 'Hello world!'. If you are unfamiliar with Python and its syntax use the web.\n",

It does not need to be all-encompassing or generally agreeable. Instead, it should highlight the aspects most important to you. Then discuss your definition with your neighbors and see whether you would stick to your original proposal or whether you tend to modify it based on the discussion."
